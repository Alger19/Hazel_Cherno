Study Diary:
20220919: Project Setup  
20220921: Entry Point Setup & Logging System  
20220922: Premake file was added.  
> Issue 1: the postmakecommands copy did not work, manual copy was required. Build Hazel at first, build Sandbox next, and then copy Hazel.dll to Sandbox folder and then rebuild Sandbox.  
> Issue 2: in the GenerateProjects.bat command vs2022 was not supported by the old version premake, latest beta version is required.
